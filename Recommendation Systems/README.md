A comprehensive web application that predicts user responses to options is called "Recommendation Systems". They are algorithms that aim to present the most meaningful and accurate products to the user by filtering helpful content from the pool containing large amounts of data. Recommendation Engines also discover data patterns in the dataset by learning about consumers' choices and generating results based on the user's needs and interests.

## What are the Recommendation System Types?

- A) Collaborative Filtering Systems
- B) Content-Based Filtering Systems
- C) Popularity-Based Recommendation Systems

### A) Collaborative Filtering Systems

It is the most used recommendation method. It is designed to provide advice by evaluating users' interactions with each other and with products. There are three types of Collaborative Filtering Systems algorithms.
- User Based
- Product based
- Model Based
